Customer Churn Analysis and Prediction using Power BI & Machine Learning

In this project, I built an end-to-end customer churn analysis and prediction system. This project analyzes customer churn patterns using Power BI dashboards and predicts future churn using a Random Forest machine learning model.

The goal is to:
- Understand key factors influencing churn
- Visualize churn trends and customer behavior
- Predict customers at high risk of churn
- Support data-driven retention strategies

The key business question addressed in this project is:
- Which customers are likely to churn, and what factors contribute most to customer churn?

Results & Insights
- Customers with shorter tenure are more likely to churn
- Month-to-month contracts have significantly higher churn rates
- Customers using electronic check show higher churn
- Revenue-impacting customers can be identified using churn probability scores
